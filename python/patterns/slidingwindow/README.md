Sliding Window Pattern

There are many algorithmic problems which requires iterating over the array/list to calculate something among all the contiguous elements of a subarray. To solves these problems we use a pattern knows as sliding window pattern. Using this pattern we iterate over the array elements keeping a window size and perform the required operation.

For example - Given an array of size 'n' calculate the maximum sum of sub array of size 'k'.

A simple brute force solution would be to iterate over the array and
