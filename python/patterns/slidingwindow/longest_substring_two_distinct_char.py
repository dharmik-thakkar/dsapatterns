# Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree,
# you are given two baskets and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket.
# The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
#
# You can start with any tree, but once you have started you canâ€™t skip a tree.
# You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot,
# i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
#
# Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.
#
# Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
# Output: 3
# Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from the subarray ['C', 'A', 'C']
#
# Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
# Output: 5
# Explanation: We can put 3 'B' in one basket and two 'C' in the other basket.
# This can be done if we start with the second letter: ['B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
